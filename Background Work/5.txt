Paper 1
The fast advancements in the fields of mobile internet and the internet of things (IoT) have caused several serious challenges 
for the traditional centralized cloud computing like large latency, small spectral efficiency (SE), and incompatible machine type
 of communication. The present article offers an overview on three edge computing technologies: mobile edge computing, cloudlets, 
and fog computing. Specifically, standardizing procedures, principle, architecture, and utility of the mentioned technologies 
will be addressed. In terms of radio access network, the mobile edge computing difference from the fog computing was described.
Features of fog computing radio access networks will be addressed as well. In the end, unsolved issues and future research topics
were discussed. Non-stop growth of interconnected IoT devices combined with strict requirements of IoT applications has greatly 
challenged the available cloud computing architectures in terms of network congestion and data privacy. One of the solutions 
to overcome the mentioned issues could be the migration of some computational resources near the users. Such approaches can 
enhance cloud efficiency by expanding its computational capability. The mentioned approach has been further developed through
 the introduction of several paradigms with their insights and a similar objective: higher resources deployment at the network
 edge. Despite their common visions, some of these paradigms are under the influence of their cases of application. For instance, 
the MEC paradigm allows constrained devices such as smartphones to offload some of their applications for saving resources. Fog 
and edge computing have gained the highest in today’s research trend.

provides data storage and computing at the edge of the
network, and provides Internet intelligent services nearby,
providing support for the digital transformation of various
industries, and meeting the requirements of different industries
for data diversication. Edge computing has become a
hot research issue. In the future, with the continuous development
of the Internet and human society, edge computing will
play a more important role and effectively promote the development
of various industries. It plays an important application
role in Content Delivery Network(CDN), industrial
Internet, energy, smart home, smart transportation, games and
other elds.

Paper 3
“A survey of virtual machine
(VM) management in edge
computing” provides an
overview on the industrial
and research projects on VM
management in edge computing.
The paper focuses on
the virtualization frameworks
and virtualization techniques,
serverless management, and
security advantages and issues
that virtualization brings to
edge computing.
“A survey on edge computing
systems and tools” reviews existing
systems and open-source
projects for edge computing by
categorizing them according to
their design demands and innovations.
In addition, topics that
are related to energy efficiency
and deep learning optimization
of edge computing systems
are discussed.
Edge computing brings together
IoT, big data, and mobile computing
into an integrated and ubiquitous
computing platform. The capability
offered to deliver on-demand computing
power at the edge and the
ability to process the vast amount of
data coming from an abundance of
devices/sensors provide a huge impetus
to artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.

Paper 5
Edge computing is a relatively recent phenomenon
in the computing world, which takes cloud computing services
closer to the end user and is distinguished by fast processing
and application response time, which leads to many advantages
such as faster and more efficient data processing; Safety;
reduced leakage on existing networks. Moreover, delaysensitive
applications may benefit from the Edge computing
paradigm's low latency, agility, and location awareness.
Significant research has been conducted in the field of Edge
computing, which is reviewed in terms of recent technologies
such as Mobile Edge Computing, Cloudlet, and Fog computing,
allowing researchers to gain a better understanding of current
and potential solutions. This article summarizes the edge
computing paradigm classification, applications, and various
challenges in detail.In this paper, we came up with most of the
applications require prompt response, so edge computing
process the data at the edge of the network that eliminates
the roundtrip travel time provides a real-time response and
native authority. At last, we put forward the edge computing
challenges. In the future, with the persistent advancement of
the Internet and human culture, edge processing will assume
a more significant job in various applications like smart
homes, smart widgets, intelligent transport, quick audio, and
video streaming.
