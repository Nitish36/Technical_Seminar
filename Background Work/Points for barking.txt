How edge computing integrated with cloud

Using real-time imaging and analytics to  improve triaging and clinician support
Complying with data locality and privacy  requirements for personal/sensitive data
Decentralising internal data to reduce  vulnerability to external attacks 
Using low-latency edge devices to optimise collection and transfer of data
Accelerating data analytics and intelligence  by bringing it closer to the source


Paper 2: Edge computing has become a hot research issue and plays an important application role in various 
fields like CDN, industrial internet, smart home, smart transportation, and games.


Autonomous vehicles 
a group of truck travel close behind one another in a convoy, saving fuel costs
and decreasing congestion. With edge computing, it will be possible to remove the need for
drivers in all trucks except the front one, because the trucks will be able to communicate with
each other with ultra-low latency.

In-hospital patient monitoring
Currently, monitoring devices (e.g. glucose
monitors, health tools and other sensors) are either not connected, or where they are, large
amounts of unprocessed data from devices would need to be stored on a 3rd party cloud. This
presents security concerns for healthcare providers.
An edge on the hospital site could process data locally to maintain data privacy.

Traffic management
Edge computing can enable more effective city traffic management. Examples of this include
optimising bus frequency given fluctuations in demand, managing the opening and closing of
extra lanes, and, in future, managing autonomous car flows.
